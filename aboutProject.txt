About Project:

    We created a messaging app, named "ChatUp!". It enables communication between 2 or more users.

    We used a python-based framework "NiceGUI" which is used for creating web applications.
    
    The messaging app we created can only send and receive text messages and not yet able to make calls or send any images/files.
    
    The messaging app can automatically generate a different avatar for each user.
