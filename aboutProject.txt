About Project:

    We created a messaging app, named "ChatUp!". It enables communication between 2 or more users.

    We used a python-based framework "NiceGUI" which is used for creating web applications.
    
    The messaging app we created can send and receive text messages from multiple users.
    
    The messaging app can automatically generate a different avatar for each user.

    Each messages sent will automaticaaly generate the current date and time.
